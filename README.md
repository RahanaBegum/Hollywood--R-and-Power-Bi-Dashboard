# Hollywoods Most Profitable Stories - Using R and Power-Bi

Using the Holywood movies dataset, I have explored Hollywood movies' most profitable stories.

# Using R studio I completed the following steps:

Import Dataset

Import Library

Check Data Types 

Check for Missing Values

Dropping the missing values

Checking for duplicates and removing them

Rounding off values to 2 d.p

Checking for outliers using a boxplot -Remove outliers in "Profitability" -Remove the outliers in 'Worldwide.Gross'

Do a Summary Statistics/Univariate Analysis using appropriate code -bivariate analysis

Write a line of code to export the clean data






# Using the clean dataset I made a dashboard analysing the following:

The average Rotten Tomatoes ratings of each genre​

The number of movies produced per year ​

The audience score for each film ​

The profitability per studio ​

The worldwide gross per genre

Profitability by genre per year

Profitability of films per year
